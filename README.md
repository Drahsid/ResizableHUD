# ResizableHUD
A plugin for Dalamud with FFXIV which lets you move and resize vanilla UI units with far greater control than the game gives.

You can find this plugin in the official Dalamud Repository.

## Usage
`/prhud` to open the configurator.

With the configurator opened, and the `Draw Addon Inspector` option enabled, you can press `Right Mouse` while mousing over a UI element to add it to your list.
