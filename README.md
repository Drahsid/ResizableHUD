# ResizableHUD
A plugin for Dalamud with FFXIV which lets you move and resize vanilla UI units with far greater control than the game gives.

To use this plugin, add `http://repo.modloader64.com/ffxiv/plugins.json` to your list of plugin repositories.

## Usage
`/prhud` to open the configurator.

With the configurator opened, and the `Draw Addon Inspector` option enabled, you can press `Right Mouse` while mousing over a UI element to add it to your list.
