# ResizableHUD
A plugin for Dalamud with FFXIV which lets you move and resize vanilla HUD units with far greater control than the game gives.

To use this plugin, add `http://repo.modloader64.com/ffxiv/plugins.json` to your list of plugin repositories.

## Usage
`/prhud` to open the configurator.

You can add units by using `/prhudadd [unit name]`. To find the name of a unit, you can look at the addon inspector using `/xldata`
